        These are the steps for a origami pigeon bird:
        <ul>
            <li> Start with a square piece of origami paper</li>
            <li>Fold the paper in half by folding the top corner to the bottom corner. You should have an upside down triangle</li>
            <li> Fold part of the top down so that the edge is about halfway down. Don't make this flap too thin because this will become the wings.</li>
            <li>Turn the paper over.</li>
            <li>Take the bottom corner of the top layer and fold it up</li>
            <li> Fold the figure in half by folding the left side over to the right.</li>
            <li>: Now fold that same flap back like this to make one of the wings.</li>
            <li>Fold the other wing back also.</li>
            <li> Push the center of the head in and flatten. This is called an inside reverse fold.</li>

        </ul>
        And tada! You have yourself a bird. Now set it free! Just kidding. Don't throw it in the air. It will just fall down and you'll be disappointed.
